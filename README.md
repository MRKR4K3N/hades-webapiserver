this is my first project about web api server so this server that i created is for
minimal server for clients but it act like web server too like you still can use
it for html web where you can put your html file in www/docs/works since this path
is long you can change the path in config file

the server have different functions and modules also you can make your own plugins
or change something in my code to make it better for you.

to run this server first set your config in the "configs/server_config.conf"

usage:
  python server.py configs/server_config.conf

*this project is not stable yet theres so many things i need to check and test*
feel free to comment about it
